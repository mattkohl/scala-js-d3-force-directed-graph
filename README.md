# Scala.js d3 Force-Directed Graph 

This is a `Scala.js` reworking of a [purely JavaScript implementation](https://bl.ocks.org/mattkohl/146d301c0fc20d89d85880df537de7b0).

### To build & run
For development, open `sbt` and execute the task `~fastOptJS`, which creates the file `target/scala-2.12/force-directed-graph-fastopt.js`. 
Open `index.html` your web browser to see the visualization.

As with other `Scala.js` projects, use `fullOptJS` for an optimized build.
